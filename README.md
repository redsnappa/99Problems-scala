# 99Problems-scala
The classic 99 problems for PROLOG: but written in Scala... see - http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

#Project Description

After completing the Coursera's Scala course, I decided to try my hand at these problems for further practice.
This project also contains unit tests written in ScalaTest, which is just a start to me playing with a new test framework.

Just a bit of fun...
